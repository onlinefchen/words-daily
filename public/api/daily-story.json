  "story": "The **bushland** held secrets. Old Man Hemlock, a retired **aeronautical engineer** who\u2019d almost **enlist**ed in the navy, believed he could **craft** a solution to save the **monarch butterfly**. Their **migratory route** took them precariously close to the **lava plateau**, now threatened by developers. Some felt they **deserve**d the land, but Hemlock saw the potential for **ecological** disaster. He shuddered, remembering the dark days of **commercial whaling**, a testament to human **cruelty**. He knew the **extremism** of unchecked progress could lead to a world where even insects were deemed **disposable**.\n\nHe was **lenient** with his own mistakes though, once accidentally using **poison** meant for a **hawkmoth** to fertilize his prize-winning **dorado** tomatoes. The local wildlife were suffering from the effect of **warm pool** contamination. He was sure he'd heard of another case of an **intestinal blockage** in the local birds. He refused to let them **enslave** nature for profit."
