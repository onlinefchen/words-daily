  "story": "Eliza felt the **PRESSURE** mounting. Her **POOR COMMAND OF ENGLISH** made the presentation even more daunting. The judge's scowl was quite **DISTASTEFUL**. This round was the **ELIMINATION** stage; successful waste **DISPOSAL** was **ESSENTIAL** for survival in the eco-challenge. Outside, the lake was **TRANQUIL**, but inside, Eliza\u2019s heart experienced a violent **OSCILLATION**.\n\nHer first attempt at separating the plastics was **SLAVISH** in its adherence to the guide, but wrong. The audience watched, mesmerized by a **SENSATIONAL** failure. She wanted to **WITHDRAW**, feeling **EMBARRASSED**. Her **IMPETUOUS** nature almost led to a meltdown. She knew that failure could feel like **EXTINCTION**. The current system felt like **EXTREMISM**. A **SEISMIC** shift in approach was needed. If she couldn't make her method **RECOGNISABLE**, she knew it would never **EVOLVE** to become **DISTINCTIVE** enough to deter any future **PREDATOR** threatening the Earth."
