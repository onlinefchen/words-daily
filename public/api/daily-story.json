  "story": "Old Silas, the **SOLE** caretaker of the river, felt the **SUFFERING** of his charge. The **DISSOLVED GAS** levels were dangerously low, threatening the **ENDANGERED** river otter. The recent **BAN** on fishing, however, was being ignored. Young, **DISOBEDIENT** boys still came, hoping to find **BULLION**, rumors of gold having spread. It was **AGGRAVATING**.\n\nSilas remembered stories his grandfather told, of the river's **EPIC JOURNEY FROM STREAM TO SEA**, a journey now choked by pollution. The town wanted to **CONDEMN** a new area for development, let factories **IMPINGE** upon the riverbank. He, and only he, seemed to care about the **ETHICAL** considerations. An **EXTENSIVE** search for a specific **FOSSIL**, part of a rare **PLEURON** species, was also threatened. He saw a discarded **HEROIN** needle near a **SHRUB**. Add **ILLITERACY** to the list of problems plaguing the town; people couldn't read the warning signs. Silas had to **EXERT** himself, even this late in life. His responsibility wasn\u2019t just **DOMESTIC**; it was for the whole river."
