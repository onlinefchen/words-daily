  "story": "Eliza\u2019s **PESSIMISM** was **chronic**. Ever since the **gaseous contaminant** leak near the **freeway**, she'd expected the worst. Her grandfather, however, refused to share her fears. He consulted the **World Health Organisation's** reports and trusted his **mechanical watch** more than the news.\n\nHe\u2019d always wanted to **preserve** the small patch of **ecology** near their home, even if **greed** tempted others to build. Eliza worried the factory was **cheating** by secretly releasing pollutants, hindering the plants\u2019 **absorption**. **Elimination** of the factory seemed impossible. He wanted to **remove** her fear of **coronary heart disease** brought on by stress.\n\n\"I **guarantee** it will be okay,\" he'd said after they **experience**d his favorite **opera** performance. He felt it was his duty, an **instinct** even, to face their challenges. He'd seen slow **increment** through scientific **popularisation** change the world for the better."
