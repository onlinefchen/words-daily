  "story": "Professor Armitage, a man who valued his **DIGNITY**, scoffed. \"To **CONCEIVE** such a thing! It's **RIDICULOUS**!\" His assistant had proposed relocating the entire **commercial fishery** five miles **DOWNSTREAM** because of potential **CONTAMINATION**. Armitage considered the idea **UNREALISTIC**; the **GROUND MOTION** alone during transport would be a disaster.\n\nHe couldn't **PROMOTE** such folly. It would **INCUR** unnecessary costs, impacting everyone from the local **THRIFT** stores to families struggling with **POVERTY**, and affecting the availability of affordable **FOOD**. His concerns weren\u2019t just economic, the whole project was driven by erroneous **COMPUTER** models! Besides, it was the **BREEDING SEASON** for the local fish. Disturbing the fish would be **mALTREAT**ing nature. He stood by the **GUM TREE**, contemplating the **ENVIRONMENT**, convinced his refusal was **EDIFYING**, even if his assistant would **PELT** him with angry emails later."
