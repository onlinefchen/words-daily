  "story": "Dr. Aris, his face etched with years of battling coastal **EROSION**, sighed as he watched the **BLUE WHALE** breach the surface. A retired marine biologist living on a modest **PENSION**, he felt a surge of **COMPASSION** for the majestic **MAMMAL**. The aging **MECHANISM** of his old boat sputtered; the **PROPELLER** needed fixing again. He could **DEDUCE** that a rogue **HORNET**, somehow finding its way so far from land, had gotten tangled in the engine. The recent news showed a **POLAR BEAR**, a **VICTIM** of climate change, stranded at sea. It prompted him to **PROTEST** more actively. His own **PHYSICAL** health was failing. He suspected his **CIRCULATORY SYSTEM** was failing. He needed **ANTICOAGULANT**s. Even a local **TROUT** seemed stressed by the increased water temperature. He felt helpless. He knew he needed **THERAPY** to find inner **STABILITY**. The only **SURVEILLANCE** was the seagulls overhead. Even a little **COSMETIC** change, like painting his boat, couldn\u2019t mask the deeper decay."
