  "story": "Barnaby, a **WORLD-WEARY** badger, watched his **DIGITAL TELEVISION** flicker. The news reported a looming **TIDAL WAVE**, another consequence, it seemed, of humanity\u2019s **OFFENSIVE** behavior towards nature. Even the **SYNTHETIC VOICE** of the anchor sounded grim.\n\nBarnaby remembered his own **EPIC JOURNEY FROM STREAM TO SEA** as a pup. He'd seen it all: farms where cows **OVERGRAZE**, decimating the **NATURAL FOOD CHAIN**, and rivers where discarded electronics skewed the **ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD**, confusing migrating **DOG SALMON**. To **PLAGIARISE** nature's beauty, only to destroy it, deserved **PUNISHMENT**.\n\nHe sighed, a **SLOTHFUL** mammal considering action. The **FLUCTUATION** of the river's current, felt **DOWNSTREAM**, spoke of melting glaciers. He could smell the coming storm, an **OLFACTORY** warning carried on the wind. He knew the **MEDIA** blamed **ILLITERACY** about the environment. But Barnaby also knew the truth: greed. Even a badger understood the damage, more than humans with all their brains, did to the world."
