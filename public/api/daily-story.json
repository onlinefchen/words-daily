  "story": "Dr. Aris, an **aspirant** **entomologist**, faced a **shortage** of funding. His grant proposal to study the influence of **volcanic landform** on local **aquatic life** and insect **larva**, particularly how runoff might **alter** their **nervous system**, was met with a **reject**. He watched his dreams almost **dissolve**. He needed to **foster** new ideas. A sudden image: could he connect terrestrial insects to marine food chains? He\u2019d read about **humpback whale** migrations and how they followed schools of **tuna** and **sardine**, their **bait**. Perhaps insects accidentally **spawn** in the ocean! A discarded piece of fruit \u2013 **disposal** issue at a beach restaurant, could **block** proper flow of water. That observation led him to his new theory: if even a **primate** can use tools, why not insects? He jumped out of his chair, excited to get back to work and leave this problem behind for once and all."
