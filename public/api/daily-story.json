  "story": "The scientist watched the eggs in **INCUBATION**. He felt it **UNREASONABLE** that such a creature, so vital to the **NATURAL FOOD CHAIN**, was now **ENDANGERED**. He tried to **CLASSIFY** the reason for their decline, but kept hitting dead ends. The species was in **JEOPARDY**. His goal was to **SHARE** his findings and **DISTRIBUTE** resources to help. He needed to **PROMOTE** awareness.\n\nThe animal, while appearing delicate, was remarkably **AGILE**, able to **BALANCE** on the thinnest branches. Introduced species threatened to **DOMINATE**, making a **DEFINITE** impact. The once lush habitat had become **BARREN**, unable to **ACCOMMODATE** the animals. To allow that to happen would **VIOLATE** his morals. If he could achieve a **BREAKTHROUGH** in understanding the mysterious virus that seemed to **AFFECT** them, he could **DEFY** the odds. He feared it was something **INFECTIOUS**."
