  "story": "Old Man Fitzwilliam, a self-proclaimed **GENIUS** and profoundly **SUPERSTITIOUS**, saw himself as the last **PAWN** against the creeping **CORRUPTION**. He lived off the land, fearing the **INDUSTRIALIZED** valley below and its **POISON** that seeped into the **RUNOFF**. He aimed to **PURIFY** the last spring, hoping to **SUSTAIN** the fragile **VEGETATION**.\n\nHe wasn't a **GREENHORN**; he knew the dangers. The **AERODYNAMIC CONSTRUCTION** of buzzard wings meant carrion, and the excessive **LITTER** signaled **OVERCROWDING** and a disregard for **HYGIENE**. Even his **NOCTURNAL VISION** couldn't miss the dwindling **ORGANISM** count in the stream. He watched a tiny **JOEY**, orphaned by tainted water, and knew his work was less than **SATISFACTORY**. He had to find the source and **DISCARD** it, before it destroyed everything."
