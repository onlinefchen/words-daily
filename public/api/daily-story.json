  "story": "Old Captain Barnaby, his **neurological** condition beginning to **degenerate**, clutched his **compass**. He was far from any charted **property**. He hoped his **acoustic faculty**, diminished by years at sea, hadn't misled him. He needed **metallic money** to care for his ailing wife. His **self-interest**, for once, outweighed all else. He had one desperate plan: catch the legendary giant **squid** said to haunt these waters.\n\nBarnaby knew his **inexperience** with squid hunting was a significant **anomaly**. He intended to **inject** air into the squid's **air sac** (if it had one) and deflate its **swim bladder**, rendering it immobile. His boat, though old, was surprisingly **flexible**. While not built for **cruising speed**, it was nimble. Even a **sparrow** could out maneuver a **cobra** on land, and Barnaby hoped to **distinguish** himself with similar ingenuity. Did he **deserve** success? Finding a squid here seemed as likely as finding a **salmon habitat** in the desert. He doubted it would work."
