  "story": "The museum curator, Mr. Davies, felt a terrible **STRAIN**. He had to **CLASSIFY** the new artifacts, including an ancient Egyptian **RELIC**. His **ENTHUSIASM**, however, was **DEVOID** of genuine joy. A recent **SCANDAL** involving a **DISHONEST** employee had left the museum\u2019s reputation in an **APPALLING** state.\n\nRumors of **CORPORAL** punishment \u2013 even **CANING** \u2013 were a **SINISTER** whisper among his staff. He needed a **REVITALISATION**, a way to **RAISE** morale. One idea was to **PROMOTE** a younger, more **STYLISH** curator. He couldn't let the museum appear **SLUTTISH**, neglecting its treasures. Mr. Davies felt **ACCOUNTABLE**. He needed to **CHERISH** the good name of his museum, **WAX** it to a shining state before his **PEER** review."
