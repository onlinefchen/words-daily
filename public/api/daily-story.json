  "story": "***\n\nOld Man Fitzwilliam, weathered like a **lava dome**, glared at the television. The local **commercial fishery** was booming, but he'd seen them **misuse** their power before. \"Time to **enforce control over advertising**,\" he muttered, remembering his **family**, and the **sacrifice** his father made to protect the waters. He felt a **negative** pull, like the opposite of **liberation**.\n\nIt was **analogous** to the **goanna** he saw yesterday, drawn by **bait**, ignoring his **circadian rhythm**. A single **scout bee**, buzzing with an internal **electromagnetic field**, disrupted his thoughts. He was old, his **ovary** long past bearing fruit (he\u2019d had it removed decades ago!), but his **sense** told him something was wrong. He knew, deep down, that soon he'd have to act. The government considered the volcano **dormant**, but he felt its rumblings. He wouldn't let anyone engage in **unlawful** actions, no matter how far **evolution** had pushed humanity. His **navigational ability**, honed over years, would guide him."
