  "story": "A tiny, **APTEROUS** insect, a beetle **LARVA**, struggled near a **FERN**. It was **UNABLE** to fly, its **CIRCULATORY** system pumping frantically. It needed to **ADAPT** or face a **CATASTROPHE**. The **FERTILE SOIL** was being tilled for an **ELECTRONIC** farm, threatening its home. Resources were starting to **DEPLETE**. A farmer tried to **BLOCK** its path with a shovel. This **REVOLUTION** in farming was not always **BENEFICIAL**. The beetle couldn't **USE UP** precious time. It knew some **CULTURAL** traditions considered harming insects a **PUNISHMENT** worthy act. He hoped the farmer believed in this, and that his home would be deemed **INVIOLABLE**. The farmer, watching a nature documentary about a **HUMPBACK WHALE**, paused, realizing the **TRULY** vast consequences of his actions. He refused to **COPY** his neighbour's harmful practices."
